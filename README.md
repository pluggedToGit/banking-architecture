# 🏦 Banking Architecture Presentation

A comprehensive enterprise banking platform architecture presentation covering modern cloud infrastructure, micro frontends, security, and performance optimization patterns.

## 🎯 Overview

This presentation demonstrates enterprise-grade banking architecture suitable for Expert Engineer level discussions, featuring:

- **Multi-Region AWS Infrastructure** with global deployment patterns
- **Dynamic Micro Frontend Architecture** with runtime discovery
- **Enterprise Security & Resilience** with ADFS integration and policy engines
- **Performance & Scalability** with multi-layer caching and fault tolerance

## 📋 Architecture Sections

### 1. 🌐 AWS Multi-Region Infrastructure
- **Global Deployment**: Route 53 geographic routing, API Gateway regional endpoints
- **Database Strategy**: Aurora Global Database, DynamoDB Global Tables
- **Networking**: Transit Gateway, VPC peering, cross-region connectivity
- **AI Integration**: SageMaker, Bedrock, and ML pipeline architecture

### 2. 🧩 Micro Frontend Architecture
- **Dynamic Discovery**: Runtime MFE registration without shell rebuilds
- **Module Federation**: Webpack 5 federation with banking-specific configurations
- **CORS Handling**: API Gateway proxy patterns and preflight optimization
- **Zero-Downtime**: Blue-green deployments with health checks

### 3. 🔐 Security & Resilience
- **ADFS Integration**: Enterprise SAML authentication with fine-grained entitlements
- **Policy Engine**: Open Policy Agent (OPA) with centralized rule management
- **JWT Security**: Token validation, refresh patterns, and audit trails
- **Compliance**: SOX, PCI DSS, and regulatory framework implementation

### 4. ⚡ Performance & Scalability
- **Multi-Layer Caching**: L1-L4 caching hierarchy (Browser → CDN → Application → Database)
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Kafka streaming with banking event schemas
- **State Management**: Distributed state with conflict resolution and optimistic updates
- **Monitoring**: Real-time performance tracking and alerting systems

## 🛠 Technical Stack

### Frontend Technologies
- **HTML5/CSS3**: Modern responsive design with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- **JavaScript ES6+**: Dynamic interactions and progressive enhancement
- **Prism.js**: Syntax highlighting for code examples
- **CSS Variables**: Theme customization and consistent design system

### Architecture Patterns
- **Micro Frontends**: Module Federation, Dynamic Imports, Runtime Discovery
- **Event Sourcing**: Kafka, EventBridge, Audit Logging
- **CQRS**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation for banking operations
- **Circuit Breaker**: Fault tolerance and graceful degradation

### Cloud Infrastructure
- **AWS Services**: API Gateway, Lambda, Aurora, DynamoDB, CloudFront
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration with HPA and service mesh
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch, X-Ray, Prometheus, Grafana
- **Security**: WAF, Shield, GuardDuty, Security Hub
